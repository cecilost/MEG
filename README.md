# Fieldtrip Preprocessing Tutorial

### requirements
- [Fieldtrip](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/download/)
- Matlab toolboxes: mostly [Signal Processing Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/signal.html) but the other toolboxes are also mentioned [here](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/faq/requirements/)
- sample data uploaded in teams
